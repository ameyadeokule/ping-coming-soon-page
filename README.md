## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Submit their email address using an `input` field
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   JavaScript DOM Manipulation
-   Regex for email validation

### What I learned

-   Email Validtion using Regex.
-   Using and styleing icons.

### Continued development

I want to write CSS in SASS or tailwind into this webpage and in future convert it to React SPA. Further would like to use email validation library like validate.js to validate email addresses so I don't miss out on boundary conditions.

### Useful resources

-   [JavaScript: HTML Form - email validation](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php?passed=passed) - Good resource on how to approach email validation in JavaScript.
-   [I hate regex cheatsheet](https://ihateregex.io/expr/email) - Use this if you need quick regex for any values.
-   [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This section helped me in better understanding flexbox and how the arrangements world
-   [A Complete Guide to CSS Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand breakpoints and how to handle HTML elements on a much smaller screen using CSS media queries.
